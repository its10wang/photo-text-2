					<p>On East Broadway, under the Manhattan Bridge, a bustling mini-mall spills out onto the sidewalk, selling noodles, candies, and dried seafood. Chinatown prepares for the Lunar New Year with red envelopes and scrolls with good luck wishes.Not long ago, this was a movie theater. The Florence Theater opened in 1911 and hosted Yiddish vaudeville and motion pictures. It was renamed New Canton Theater in 1942 and became known for Peking opera. During WWII, a Hong Kong opera troupe stranded in America put on daily performances for ten years. In 1950, LIFE magazine called the New Canton “only Chinese theater in America.”</p>

				<p>The theater was renamed again in 1950 as the Sun Sing Theater. Shortly after, Peking opera production ceased, and Sun Sing began showing Cantonese films. In the 1970s, the city needed to add another deck to the Manhattan Bridge, and Sun Sing Theater was on the verge of being demolished. With many Chinatown residents working long days in restaurants and sweatshops, Cantonese cinema was one of the few affordable and pleasurable escapes available in the neighborhood. Theatergoers banded together to save the structure, and engineers reached an agreement by removing some theater seats and adding supports to keep the structure intact.</p>
				<img src="images/untitled folder/sun-sing-theatre.jpeg" width="400" height="" alt="" class="center-block"/><p>The Sun Sing Theater, considered the grandest of all Chinatown theaters and known for showing double features (a rare occurrence these days), showed Cantonese films with English subtitles on occasion. During the theater's final years, a marketing campaign was launched to reach out to English-speaking fans of Asian crime and martial arts films; after paying for admission, moviegoers were given a brief, typed-up synopsis of each film. Sun Sing became the site of Chinese gang-related shootings and activities, mirroring fiction.</p>
			    <p>Nonetheless, Chinatown residents, influenced by Cantonese cinema, continued to attend the theater. The Sun Sing Theater was one of five in Chinatown.</p>
